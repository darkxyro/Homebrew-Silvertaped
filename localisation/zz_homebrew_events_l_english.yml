 homebrew.1.d:0 "Welcome to Homebrew, a submod for Anbennar. Before you start, I'd like to take a moment to go over some of the details of Homebrew.\n\nSome of the ideas on this mod directly adds modifiers to your provinces. In order to minimize performance loss, all of these ideas include a decision you have to take when you take the idea. Please understand this limitation, I hope you can still enjoy the effects these ideas have to offer.\n\nEconomies have been inflated to adjust for all the modifiers found in Homebrew and Anbennar in general. Things will be more expensive than you're used to, and manpower will be slightly more scarce. You should only start feeling a difference past the early game. Please take this into consideration when managing your budget.\n\nHomebrew was made with the intent of making Anbennar more fun and interesting to play. So please, enjoy yourself!"

 homebrew.4.d:0 "As the faith of Ravelianism spreads throughout Cannor, a circle of world-renowned artificers are invited to meet in the neutral meeting place of Núrael. Here, throughout the course of two months, the great minds of Halann met and discussed the future of the burgeoning craft of artificery. Many things were discussed and argued, but evferyone in attendance agreed on one thing: artificery is at its worst when it oversteps the boundaries of morals. Under the approval of the High Rectorate, the artificers of Núrael have written a contract to be signed by all good-minded men and women practicing artificery - that they are to uphold the good name of artificers everywhere, and never to sacrifice their moral integrity for the sake of progress. Anyone who refuses to sign this contract will be vilified by the global community."

The convention has the backing of the High Rectorate itself, and should $MONARCH$ refuse to give their signature, [Root.GetName] will be left diplomatically isolated."

And in these times of war, $COUNTRY$ needs every advantage it can get. The Cracker has been untested, that is true, but when has the Chief Artificer ever let $MONARCH$ down?

The Chief Artificer was missing his meals, strange happenings were occuring at night, and the janitorial staff has had mysterious disappearances twice this past year. $MONARCH$ was willing to look the other way, but how could [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] today when the stench of death wafted out from the laboratory door? \n\nStepping in uninvited, $MONARCH$ saw the Chief Artificer attending to a tabletop of instruments, feeding fresh wood into a stove, and taking measurements of... is that a dead body?! \n\n"Oh, my $MONARCHTITLE$." The Chief Artificer looked up from his work. "What a surprise. I'm afraid my latest work is still in its trial phase." He muttered a few words into his hands before magically starting the stove fire. "I can show you, if you'd like. However, I need some time for the ingredients to boil. While we wait, would you like to hear a story?""

 homebrew_idea.13.d:0 "$MONARCH$ was intrigued by the letter of invitation [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Chief Artificer, claiming to have made a new breakthrough on weapons manufacturing. He has never taken an interest in weapons until now, what may have caused this shift? $MONARCH$ shrugged, finished [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cup of Aelantir-imported coffee, and started [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] day with a visit to the laboratory. \n\nThe Chief Artificer was very excited when $MONARCH$ arrived. "My $MONARCHTITLE$," he said, "I see you have gotten my letter. I must apologize to you for not being by your side for these past few years - as I'm sure you know, I was busy exploring the wilds of Insyaa with a few colleagues of mine. The expedition was estimated to only take four or five years, but when our ship crashed we were stranded on the mainland for another year before we could make it back to civilization. Poor Jamison couldn't make it - but it was thanks to him that we didn't starve." Before $MONARCH$ could speak up, the artificer walked further into the laboratory, past the cages of Necrolyzed and Loyala-bound test subjects, and to a small box of varnished wood. \n\nThe artificer gingerly equipped a pair of leather gloves, before opening the box and fetching its contents. "The great beasts of Insyaa have remarkable physiologies," he began, "Did you know the natives worship them as living deities? They are more like a forest fire than they are ordinary creatures. And, after a chance encounter, I came in possession of a remarkable tissue sample. I must say, this one's blood has truly fascinating properties. What if I told you, my $MONARCHTITLE$, that this particular one had two salivary glands? One acts as normal, but the other has a peculiar property." \n\nThe artificer holds in his hand a small cup of thick, viscous saliva. He then moves to his workbench, where $MONARCH$ watched him take a musketball with a pair of tweezers and dip it into the spittle. "Upon contact with warm, living flesh, the saliva reacts, hardening and trapping air or liquid in small bubbles - the size of this "tumor" varies, and always exhibits extreme adhesive properties. My current hypothesis is that the beast would use its saliva as a cauterization agent, literally licking their wounds closed. However, we can use this saliva for so much more than simple bandaging.""

 homebrew_idea.14.d:0 "The Chief Artificer held the soiled musketball with his gloved hands, grinning to himself as he fished out a ring of keys and approached the cages. "You there, step forward!" He barked at the nearest test subject, who $MONARCH$ noted was a Necrolyzed human. The subject looked hideous, its pale and bruised skin clinging to its bones, with several unhealed gunshot wounds, and what really made $MONARCH$ reel back were the tumors. Swollen lumps of flesh, ranging in size from an Anbennar-standard crown to a clenched fist, dotted the putrid flesh and raised its rotting colors up from the subject's bones in an affront to nature. \n\nThe artificer stayed the subject with a command, and gently placed the musketball on its exposed shoulder. Immediately a glossy film covered the lead ball, expanding before $MONARCH$'s eyes as it took on a blood-hed hue. It grew, and grew, bloody bubbles growing and splitting off one another, until the frothing settled and there was only a foamy, red ball sticking to the subject, almost as large as the sores poking from underneath. The artificer grabbed onto the ball and pulled, demonstrating the saliva's adhesive properties, until the Necrolyzed flesh proved its weakness and the subject's shoulder was stripped away, still glued tightly to the foam. $MONARCH$ did not try to see what the subject's sores looked like underneath, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] merely gave a thumbs up as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] searched for something to relieve [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sickness with. \n\n"My apologies, my $MONARCHTITLE$." The artificer said. "I forget sometimes that not everyone can appreciate the study of nature like I do. I assure you, though, that my "Bullet Worms" can cause untold chaos to the enemy. What kind of field surgeon has ever dealt with wounds like these? What kind of man can fight with a tumor like this in their system?" Behind him, the Necrolyzed subject shudders, before crumpling to the ground. "For example! I've had to re-necrolyze this body every two or three test fires. My $MONARCHTITLE$, Necrolyzed bodies normally take twice as many bullet wounds to go down. I believe that Bullet Worms could win entire wars for us!" \n\nThe artificer patted $MONARCH$ on the back as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finished heaving.

From inside, [Root.GetArtificeKhetgirl] And on the other side, the Chief Artificer stood behind a control panel with vents and pipes running into the wall. "Ah, my $MONARCHTITLE$," The Chief Artificer says as he notices $MONARCH$, "I see I need to soundproof this testing chamber.

The sound of rushing steam filled the room, and beyond the glass wall $MONARCH$ noticed movement. A vent that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] didn't see before shut open, and upon its clattering noise the assistant artificer began beating at the glass again. "You lunatics! He'll kill us all!" The Chief Artificer frowned a moment, before briskly walking over to a wardrobe and fetching a pile of wet rags. He handed one to $MONARCH$ "It's best you hang onto this, my $MONARCHTITLE$. Just in case." $MONARCH$ took one sniff of it, and promptly handed it over to a guard. \n\nOut of the vents, a sickly yellow gas began to trickle out, hugging the floor. "I'm sure you have heard of the great plague that struck the Serpentspine Mountains, my $MONARCH$." The Chief Artificer began. "They call it Serpent's Rot, and it killed without mercy. Whole generations were lost in a matter of years. The outbreak eventually went away, as they always do, of course. But you see, my $MONARCH$, it can be recreated." \nThe assistant beat upon the glass like a mad Harimari, eyes big as dinnerplates. "Serpent's Rot has a peculiar property - it cannot spread beyond the Serpentspine Mountains. I did a little digging, and discovered the reason was in the air. The properties of the air in the Serpentspine is different than anywhere else, making it the only place where Serpent's Rot can naturally occur." More gas flowed into the chamber, reaching to the assistant's waist, and as the assistant grew more and more desperate, $MONARCH$ jumped at the sound of creaking glass. \n\n"So, I hypothesized that with a sample of the air, a pinch of fertilizer, and a little bit of transmutation magic, I could recreate Serpent's Rot outside of its natural habitat. The Serpent's Rot would remain in the gas, and be released on our enemies when the time is right. Observe." The Chief Artificer watched remorselessly as the gas continued to rise. The assistant beat at the glass again and again, but it was not enough, and as she breathed in a rotting color spread across her veins. In a matter of minutes, the assistant had collapsed, her skin bloated and leaking pus. "[Root.GetArtificeKhetgirlDed]. For your safety, I've taken the liberty of adding in some colored dye. The plague itself can be stored in a safebox, and can be introduced to pre-mixed Serpentspine air through a more compact version of what we have here. Any soldier could carry this into battle." The Chief Artificer hesitated. "Of course, you can't have any rookie handle ordnance this dangerous. Best you leave this to trained experts." He pulled another handle, venting the gas out of the chamber and out of sight."

Did you know, my $MONARCHTITLE$, that vampires gain eternal youth by feeding on others' blood? One time, my former master decided to tell me how certain races' blood were more potent than others, how it could satiate his hunger for longer. The blood had a special power of its own, one that only the vampire could harness. I was inspired. I learned then and there, that magic can be trapped and contained not just in machines and spells, but also our very bodies. Why should artificers limit themselves to nuts and bolts, when there exists flesh and bone? So after earning my freedom, and trading him some of my secrets for a barrel of elven blood - " \n\nA hissing steam broke the Chief Artificer's concentration. "Ah yes, it's ready!" He removed a pot of vile broth from the stove, pouring its contents into a flask. "This here is my latest foray into the unknown. The art of necromancy, the forbidden magic, is a secret jealously kept by liches and witch kings. Well, my $MONARCHTITLE$, I've developed an alternative." \n\nThe Chief Artificer stepped over to the body on the table, stinking of death.

To prove his point, he waited a few moments. From the cadaver's pouched belly, a rumbling, gurgling growl escaped, and $MONARCH$ could briefly see bioluminescence from underneath. With a start, the subject's eyes opened. It did not speak words, only groaning and grunting as it took in the world around it. "A fantastic success!" The Chief Artificer exclaimed. "Necrolyzer does come with a loss of intelligence, among other things, but it should understand Common. Hey, you! Greet your $MONARCHTITLE$!"

However, all failed to impress, showing only mechanical toys and gadgets that $MONARCH$ had seen dozens of times before. \n$MONARCH$ was about to end the day's events when a late arrival appeared before him. An enigmatic young human man, dressed in Esmari fashion entirely unbefitting of his work, presented an empty table, a toolkit, and a nervous assistant. "My $MONARCHTITLE$," he began, "It is an honor to be here in your presence. I understand that you're looking for a talented artificer. I assure you, I have what you need." \n\nThe artificer gestured to his assistant. "Say hello, Jamison." The assistant akwardly bowed his head. "Jamison has problems of his own, my $MONARCHTITLE$. You see, he was recently rejected from a magister academy on the grounds of a low affinity to magic. He could have decided to spend the next decade of his life knee-deep in dusty tomes, and still be outclassed by a young Silverblood. Instead, he sought me out. You see, my $MONARCHTITLE$, I had been seeking a willing subject for my latest masterpiece." The artificer brought out a small box, and inside there was what looked like a small nugget of iron, no bigger than a grape. "I am sure you are aware of how artificery is a marriage of magic and machine, my $MONARCHTITLE$. But are we not all machines, too? Let me show you, with a surgery!" \n\nThe artificer cast an illusion, muting Jamison's senses has he was placed onto the table. \nThe next few minutes were a blur, as $MONARCH$ watched with morbid curiousity as the artificer set Jamison on the table and began cutting into the base of his neck. In broad daylight, the artificer exposed his assistant's spine, and placed the iron box. He firmly pressed the box down into the open wound, shifting it ever so slightly, before pressing the flesh closed and cauterizing it with some magic fire. $MONARCH$ could spot a slight buldge underneath the burned skin - and as the artificer stooped down to check on the assistant, a similar buldge could be found on his own neck. \nJamison awoke after several minutes, and against all odds could cast magic that would rival an elf's."

"I must say, working with the ancient dwarven language was a unique challenge, I've still got a lot to learn of their grammar. But nevermind that, there is something else that I mixed into this!" The Chief Artificer laid his palm on the pedestal. Just above his palm, another illusion spell projected the image of a second disembodied hand. "Illusion magic is a funny thing, my $MONARCHTITLE$. It is often associated with bending reality, bending information, it is the antithesis of rune magic. But it doesn't have to be that way. The naked eye cannot understand what a rune sees, but illusion magic can create an abstraction. A skilled artificer like myself can also include divination magic, and broaden the scopes of what a rune can detect. This pedestal can scan you and create an accurate represenation of your skeleton. But, there is one final ingredient that makes my latest invention so useful!" \n\nThe Chief Artificer turned $MONARCH$'s attention to his own face, a face $MONARCH$ has taken for granted. The artificer's right eye was missing, and in its place a steel orb was nestled. Where a pupil should be, a faintly glowing rune swiveled and took in its surroundings. "Portability is a great boon to have, my $MONARCHTITLE$, which is why I made sure that I could compress the complexity of these runes into something smaller. A unique advantage to making it your eye is that it's more efficient - you don't need an illusion spell to project an image, you can just trick your brain into seeing the image! These 'Dwarf's Eyes' are leagues more complex than my prior inventions, but I assure you that they can be produced on a larger scale. I would only advise my $MONARCHTITLE$ to restrict their installation to trained surgeons.""

 homebrew_idea.38.d:0 ""My experiments regarding the Khet?" The Chief Artificer looked at $MONARCH$ with surprise. "How did you...? Well, my $MONARCHTITLE$, I didn't take you for someone with such skill in subterfuge. I suppose I could divulge my findings on the matter." \n\n"I remember studying the Khet about... some time ago. I was working on comission of a wealthy patron - I'm sorry, my $MONARCHTITLE$, but I'm obliged to keep my clients' identities a close secret. He was a worshipper of Elikhet, the patron deity of the Khet people, and was looking for a solution to the Khets' lack of numbers. My first approach was a simple fertility potion, but there was an unforseen complication. Khet are divine in nature, which so far is my only explanation as to why my drugs had no effect on them. Then there's their curse. Did you know, my $MONARCHTITLE$, that the Khet are compelled to their homeland of Kheterata? Bringing a Khe outside of their homeland results in them entering a trance and doing everything possible to return. I tried to get a specimen myself, but as soon as its boat left harbor it jumped ship and drowned." \n\nMy second attempt at increasing the Khet popoulation took a different approach. If I can't make them breed faster, whether by fertility or disposition, then I would simply have to create them artificially. I temporarily moved my operations to Kheterata, and got to work studying the Khet anatomy. The work was very slow, my $MONARCHTITLE$, the locals did not care for my efforts and I was not welcome in their temples. The Khet anatomy is also deceptively complex, you can't simply stitch a cat onto a human and call it a day." $MONARCH$ wondered why the Chief Artificer would come to such conclusion. "Alas, I had to report my failure to my client. He wasn't happy, of course, but there was little I could do."\n\nThe Chief Artificer mulled that last line over. "That said, my $MONARCHTITLE$, a long time has passed since then. I think I still have my notes on the Khet lying around. If it would please you, then I could apply my latest inventions to laying this experiment to rest once and for all.""

 homebrew_idea.39.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has been seeing cats wandering the palace for often as of late. Ever since [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gave the go-ahead, the Chief Artificer has been hard at work applying his craft to realize the birth of an artifical Khet. It has been many months since then, perhaps it is time for a progress report? \n\nThe smell of death greeted $MONARCH$ as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] entered the laboratory. A cat lined with stitches ran between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] legs and away from the place. Before $MONARCH$ was a terribly familiar sight, with the bodies of test subjects filling a stack of cages and awaiting experimentation. The Chief Artificer was busy at his operating table, before he noticed $MONARCH$. \n\n"My $MONARCHTITLE$," he started, "Please mind the smell, it's unavoidable when working with Necrolyzer. Its uses outweigh its annoyances, I assure you. Come over here, a second." The Chief Artificer made space, revealing his latest work. On the operating table, a naked human body laid decapitated, and sewn to its head was an oversized cat's head smelling somewhat of pickles. "The beauty of Necrolyzer is that it surpresses the body's rejection of foreign bodies. With some food and some time, this specimen could naturally attatch the head to rest of the body. There's still the matter of the brain, but that can be solved later. How about we wake this one up?" \n\nThe Chief Artificer pulled a flask of Necrolyzer from his belt, and poured its contents down the creature's throat. Its effects were immediate, its muscles locking for a brief moment before it took a gasp of air. The creature laid there, chest rising and falling, before an unholy gurgling left its mouth. It rolled off the table, $MONARCH$ and the Chief Artificer standing back as it crawled on the stone floor. The creature tried to stand, making it up on one knee, before a sicking split of flsh was heard and its head came loose. It collapsed with a squelch, black fluids pouring out of the thing's neck and making $MONARCH$ wish [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] never had a nose. \n\n"...I see." The Chief Artificer began to collect the body parts off the floor. "I;m afraid to say Necrolyzer also has a side effect - the degradation of all bodily functions. I've tried to correct this, but the formula simply won't work without sacrificing bodily integrity. My $MONARCHTITLE$, I think the experiment - no, the entire project - is a failure."

It almost felt like the enimagic man had falled off the face of Halann. However, progress was still being made, as just a month ago $MONARCH$ had spotted a flyer offering jobs to the locals as part of a "public trial." It was time to pay the Chief Artificer a visit. \n\nA perculiar sight greeted $MONARCH$ upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] visit, with a groggy peasant walking away with a wooly hat and rubbing a coin in their hand. Inside, the Chief Artificer wiped his tools clean of blood, and was talking to another stranger wearing a similar hat before he noticed $MONARCH$. "My $MONARCHTITLE$," he began, "Just the person I wanted to see. I believe you'll want to see this. Remove your hat!" At once, the stranger pulled off her hat. "I slipped her some Loyala as an anesthetic," The Chief Artificer explained, "Don't worry, she's perfectly harmless and has been instructed to take more Loyala on her own. More importantly, my $MONARCHTITLE$, I have made a breakthrough." $MONARCH$ could now see the woman's scalp was clean shaven, a fine layer of hair interrupted by square patches of baldness. And on those patches of bare skin, were two flabs of skin and cartilege, resembling a cat's ears. \n\n"Transmutation magic is remarkably underused." The Chief Artificer said. "Most practitioners spend their entire careers bendng over some crops in a field. But you see, my $MONARCHTITLE$, that's exactly what makes it so useful. With a spell, you can make things grow! Why stop at growing crops, when you can grow livestock? And when you can turn a calf into a cow within a week, why stop at making it an ordinary cow? A transmuter can change a life with a pass of their hand, and they waste that power on growing a tree!" The Chief Artificer held one of the woman's cat ears in his hand. "But I won't, my $MONARCHTITLE$. You see, you can use transmutation magic to mutate a body, make it grow what it normally doesn't. Of course, a reckless mage would just make you die of cancer. There are many specifics to growing a body part, that a normal mage would have to spend countless spells and repeated treatments to make it work. Which is why I've included a dash of dwarven rune magic, here." He runs a finger along the woman's shaved head, outlining two unnatural lumps underneath her skin. "Khet implants, my $MONARCHTITLE$. By setting timers and conditions to the transmutation magic, I can safely make a body create outgrowths like these false ears. I'm confident this could be recalibrated to fully transmute the head into a Khet's, but..." The Chief Artificer took a moment to appreciate his handiwork. "I must say, I think I prefer just adding the ears. It's more aesthetically pleasing, my $MONARCHTITLE$."

It sniffed the air, and licked its lips before going back to its business and trotting off. $MONARCH$ could now notice many cats wandering the laboratory, some investigating the man while others pawed furiously at the door. In a corner, stacks of iron cages held even more cats, and... something else. A decapited human laid crumpled in one of the cages, naked and marked with incisions and stitches all across its body. $MONARCH$ could see tufts of fur sticking haphazardly from one of the lesions, matted and filthy. Other cages held other creatures, cats who couldn't be called cats, for they had features that were unmistakenly non-feline. One cat treaded on spindly, furless legs ending with human feet. Another hung from the cage ceiling with its four human hands. Another laid still, its body anchored to the floor by a human head stitched onto its neck.\n\nThe man got up from his work, and it was then that $MONARCH$ could make out his latest affront to nature: a dead human baby, its head cut open and filled with bits and pieces of metal and ceramic. The man approached one of the untouched cats, cast a spell on its, and without any hesitation cut its ears off with a knife. He then returned to the dead child, and began fixing the freshly cut ears in the head's opening. \n\n$MONARCH$ could take no more, and commanded the mirror to be taken away."
