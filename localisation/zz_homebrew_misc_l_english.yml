 ArtificeArrestSerpentrot:0 ""The Artificer is mine!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, standing before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal retinue of palace guards. "I will arrest him myself!" \n\nAn emergency evacuation of the palace was called for after [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men saw the telltale yellow clouds of Serpentrot roll through the halls. With such a potent force as Serpentrot at the Chief Artificer's disposal, trying to fight him head-on would be suicide. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a solution, and from his pocket fished out the old, stinking rag that the Chief Artificer himself gave [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in case of an unexpected outbreak. Tying the fetid rag around his mouth, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stepped into the gas... and felt perfectly fine. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] approached the laboratory, stepping over the bodies of guards and gouls strewn all over. \n\nThe Chief Artificer was gone by the time [Root.Monarch.GetName] entered the laboratory, the Serpentrot distracting everyone and letting him slip away. [Root.Monarch.GetName] rooted around, finding nothing left but some damp rags and a bowl of crushed fungi. \n\nThe artificer had escaped, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] was not about to let him come back. From $CAPITAL_CITY$ to the lowliest street corner, a king's ransom was listed as the bounty for the Mad Artificer - dead or alive."
 ArtificeArrestBulletWorms:0 ""The Artificer is mine!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, standing before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal retinue of palace guards. "I will arrest him myself!" \n\nEvery moment that passed by, another soldier was dragged away screaming in agony. Bloody pustules marked their skin, and one could know by the screams when another Bullet Worm broke through the skin or snapped a bone. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stayed at the front line of what once was the palace hallways, now occupied by the artificer's entrenched forces with orders to shoot on sight. But the traitrous artificer did not know something - the existance of a secret tunnel leading to the laboratory, which [Root.Monarch.GetName] crawled inside. \n\nThe Chief Artificer was busy packing his things when [Root.Monarch.GetName] broke in, caught completely off-guard. The artificer brandished a pistol, aimed, and missed wildly before being tackled to the ground. One precise cut later, and the artificer lied defeated, his good arm bleeding profusely. \n\n"Damn... I really should have practiced my aim more." The artificer sputtered out. "We were destined for greatness, you and I. But now, it's come to this. May the fires of damnation consume you!" The artificer chomped his teeth, and something audibly snapped. Brilliant blue flames burst all over him, wicking away his flesh and clothes and burning until the artificer was naught but a charred skeleton. An unsettling feeling came over [Root.Monarch.GetName], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt that the artificer wasn't truly dead. Maybe a celebratory drink will calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves."
 ArtificeArrestNecrolyzer:0 ""The Artificer is mine!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, standing before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal retinue of palace guards. "I will arrest him myself!" \n\nThe screams of the damned filled the halls of the palace as a swarm of undead gouls beset [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men. The Chief Artificer has made a fine work of the [Root.GovernmentName]'s resources, turning them against [Root.Monarch.GetName] here in this battle. As yellowed teeth gnashed against the swords and pikes of the palace guard, [Root.Monarch.GetName] lunged forward and put years of martial training into every swing of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade. And in the corner of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eye, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] spotted him. \n\nThe Chief Artificer was in a hurry, emptying shelves and stuffing books into a bag that never stretched or sagged. "The Leechdens sound lovely this time of year, maybe I should go there first and-" Upon seeing [Root.Monarch.GetName], he flung the bag over his shoulder and reached for a musket lying nearby. [Root.Monarch.GetName] was upon him in an instant, and in one blow the artificer lied defeated, his good arm bleeding profusely. \n\n"Damn... you could have just told me not to produce Necrolyzer, [Root.Monarch.GetName]." The artificer sputtered out. "There's so much more we could have done together. But now, it's come to this. May the fires of damnation consume you!" The artificer chomped his teeth, and something audibly snapped. Brilliant blue flames burst all over him, wicking away his flesh and clothes and burning until the artificer was naught but a charred skeleton. An unsettling feeling came over [Root.Monarch.GetName], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt that the artificer wasn't truly dead. Maybe a celebratory drink will calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves."
 ArtificeArrestNone:0 ""The Artificer is mine!" [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, standing before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] loyal retinue of palace guards. "I will arrest him myself!" \n\nThe doors to the laboratory were smashed down, lying broken in splinters on the floor. Foul creations descended upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men, seemingly acting as the artificer's security. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had no idea what they might be, but had no intention of finding out. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cut them down [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], and trampled over their malformed corpses and spotted his target. \n\nThe Chief Artificer was in a hurry, emptying shelves and stuffing books into a bag that never stretched or sagged. Upon seeing [Root.Monarch.GetName], he flung the bag over his shoulder and reached for his dagger. [Root.Monarch.GetName] noticed a sheen of glistening poison on its edge. The artificer swung first, trying to feint [Root.Monarch.GetName], but the $MONARCHTITLE$ was no stranger to fights. In a brief exchange, the artificer lied defeated, his good arm bleeding profusely. \n\n"Agrados curse you, [Root.Monarch.GetName]." The artificer spat. "We could have helped one another. But now, it's come to this. May the fires of damnation consume you!" The artificer chomped his teeth, and something audibly snapped. Brilliant blue flames burst all over him, wicking away his flesh and clothes and burning until the artificer was naught but a charred skeleton. An unsettling feeling came over [Root.Monarch.GetName], and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt that the artificer wasn't truly dead. Maybe a celebratory drink will calm [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nerves."
 ArtificeStrikeDomination:0 ""Bring me the Chief Artificer." [Root.Monarch.GetName] ordered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] guard captain. "It will be done." He replies, and walks off to do the deed. \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] waited long into the night for the captain's return, pacing the floor. There were no sounds of struggle. The Chief Artificer wasn't present for dinner today. Surely he has been captured? Yes, the guards were merely having their fun in the dungeon, and any moment now - \n\n"My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]" The guard captain called out, stepping from the shadows. "It has been done." [Root.Monarch.GetName] smiled, walking over to the captain... but then... \n\n"And here I am." The Chief Artificer appeared behind the captain. "My [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], you're hardly the most subtle master I've worked for. Shame on you, now I have to run away and find someone else more worthy of my work. And I must say, your captain here did a terrible job trying to capture me. Say you're sorry." \n\n"I'm sorry, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]" the captain spoke without a second thought. [Root.Monarch.GetName] looked closer, eyes wide. The captain's eyes were glossed over like a pair of marbels, a clear symptom of a Domination Potion. "You lack spirit, captain of the guard." The Chief Artificer moved beside him, handing him a dagger. "You will show your [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] just how sorry you are by killing him. That is an order!" Years of training kicked in, and the captain lunged at [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 ArtificeStrikeNone:0 ""The Chief Artificer will answer for his crimes," [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared, "tommorow. I must sleep on this. Today's drinking has left me... particularly tired." \n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] awoke, he couldn't move. There were no bindings on him, no cuts or bruises, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was still in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] bed with the covers over [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. But no matter how hard [Root.Monarch.GetName] tries, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] cannot move a single muscle. What was happening?! \n\n"Good morning, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]." A voice said - the Chief Artificer's voice. "I hope you slept well. I, for one, was quite busy last night. A little birdie told me someone was out to get me. I wanted to show you my latest invention some other way, but here we are." The Chief Artificer stepped into view, and at his chest held a flask of violet liquid. "I call it the "Domination Potion," my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One part neutral base, two parts orc tranquilizer, and one enchantment spell from yours truly. Anyone who drinks this enters a mild state of hypnosis, and can be suggested by a verbal command. Like how you are lying there right now! And now, you will tell me this is an excellent invention." \n\n"This is an excellent invention." \n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] did not say it himself, but the words were spoken, and he listened helplessly. "I'm glad you agree! But alas, work must be done. I have a carriage waiting for me outside, and a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to kill." The Chief Artificer smiled. "But wait, I won't do the killing. You will, won't you?" [Root.Monarch.GetName] was handed a dagger. \n\n"Kill yourself, that's an order.""

A great light engulfed the city of $CAPITAL_CITY$, clawing its way into the sky and, for the briefiest of moments, eclipsing even Surael's light. And then, the city vanished in a catastrophic explosion heard and felt across Bulwar. Unimaginable destruction erupted from the now long-gone city, breaking the ground and scattering firey winds. The great rivers of Suran and Buranun shifted course, flooding the riverbanks and laying waste to Bulwar's most fertile land. From the Salahad, a sandstorm like none before it engulfed the desert in its fury. And above the chaos and death, an omen of things to come: clouds of ash."

All across the Dwarovar, searing heat rushed down its rails and baked its inhabitants alive upon the sizzling stones. The luckier ones instead met their ends crushed by cave-ins and collapsing buildings, all while tremors shook the mountains. Those who remain huddle in the shelter of their holds, knowing full well that no matter how deep they dig, when they look up all they can see is ash."

All across $COUNTRY$, great earthquakes broke and scattered the ground, swept away by swirling storms and rushing floods, then baken dry in an all-consuming fire. $COUNTRY$ was not the only victim, either, the wave of destruction striking without mercy at all who stood in its way. \n\nAll across Halann, the rumbles and aftershocks the the Halann Cracker could be felt. And then, the world's greatest fear revealed itself. A dark cloud spread over the sky, and where the sun once shined there was only ash."
